# Spotify-dataset-analysis
Spotify is one of the largest music platforms which has millions of songs from different languages and over 200 million monthly subscribers from all over the world. It provides high quality user experience and generates music content based on the user’s interest and preferences. Spotify makes this possible by making use of AI and ML algorithms in order to create user specific song lists based on the user’s favorite genre and albums. Spotify platform stores the features of each song along with its popularity score voted by the users. These song features are calculated either by ML models or using sophisticated tools and technologies. These features can be analyzed to understand different types of songs and gain some insights about the top popular songs. Spotify continues to rule the music streaming industry because of its ability to better understand its customers' preferences and recommend songs based on the user’s history and listening patterns.
